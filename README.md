## Introduction

Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. This repository is designed to help aspiring programmers learn Python through hands-on practice. The programs provided here are carefully crafted to introduce key concepts progressively, making it easier for learners to grasp the fundamentals of Python programming.

## Getting Started with Google Colab

Google Colab is a free, cloud-based environment that allows you to write and execute Python code within interactive notebooks. To get started with Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. **Google Account**: Make sure you have a Google account. If not, create one.
2. **Access Google Colab**: Open your web browser and navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. **Create a New Notebook**: Click on "New Notebook" to create a new Colab notebook.
4. **Coding Environment**: Colab provides a coding environment where you can write and execute Python code cells.
5. **Save to Google Drive**: You can save your Colab notebooks to your Google Drive for easy access and collaboration.

## Programs

### 1. Hello, World!

- **Description**: The classic introductory program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- **Key Concepts**: Printing to the console, basic syntax.

### 2. Variables and Data Types

- **Description**: Learn how to declare variables and work with different data types, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- **Key Concepts**: Variables, data types, type conversion.

### 3. Conditional Statements

- **Description**: Explore the usage of if statements to create conditional behavior in your programs.
- **Key Concepts**: If statements, comparison operators, logical operators.

### 4. Loops

- **Description**: Learn about the for loop and while loop constructs to automate repetitive tasks.
